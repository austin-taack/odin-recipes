# Recipes (from the Odin Project)
A basic web page practice project displaying various recipes.
This is my attempt at the [Odin Project's recipe website](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).
The goal of this project was to teach the very basics of web development, getting a basic website up and running using
nothing more than vanilla HTML and CSS.
